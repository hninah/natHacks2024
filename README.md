## Self Assisted Rehabilitation Machine 
A machine designed to help patients with rehabilitation of motor skills in their hands by providing "self-assisted" electrical stimulation to the area. It is self-assisted because the level of stimulation thorugh the TENs pads are determined by the amplitude of beta waves which are associated with consious thought and logical thinking. 
### Hardware and software architecture

Muse 2 : Used to detect focus levels of the patient which we base on the amplitude of beta waves collected from the EEG signals received 
NeuroStimDuino : Used to deliver electrical stimulation to neural tissues in the hand with an intensity based focus level of the patient
Breadboard Setup : Use LED lights controlled by the Arduino to provide real-time feedback on the strength of the induced grip
